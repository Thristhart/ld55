# Overview

start_items: Axe, Forest Access, Squirrel Recipe, And the immovable Temple

Summoning creatures by arranging cards, eh?

So step 1 is get branches. (Isn't it always?)

- Combine Axe + Tree = Branch
  Then we arrange 5 wood in a pentag(ram/on) around the temple to hire a squirrel.

Squirrel is basic worker unit, can produce many things, wood in forest

Overlay some distinct cards to form an Exodia and "win?"
